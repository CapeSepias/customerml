/**
 * The Auth Callback URI is the URI within your app that accepts 
 * an OAuth2 callback request. This URI is provided through the app 
 * registration process. 
 * 
 * When a merchant installs an app for the first time, they are redirected 
 * to the appâ€™s Auth Callback URI.
 *
 * Auth Callback URIs must accept a GET request, which includes a temporary 
 * code to exchange for an access token and the list of scopes which the user 
 * has granted access to.
 * 
 * The AuthCallbackHandler must be used within a HTTPS server that accepts 
 * GET requests, and is responsible for saving these tempory AUTH data.
